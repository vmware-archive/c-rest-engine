Bugzilla Id: 2076723

Category: New feature/Critical

Description:
In secure version (HTTPS) of c-rest-engine, all connection requests are transactional. 
This means each request is served via new connection. This introduces steps involving 
openssl handshake which is known to cause significant performance delays.

Requirements:
1. Re-use TCP connections originating from same host and port to server.
2. Support HTTP header "connection: keep-alive"

Feature Testing:
Use available libcurl based client to open one single connection and send multiple
HTTP(S) request.

Steps to test.
1. Compile the persistentConnection.c file with the following command.
   "gcc -o persistentConnection persistentConnection.c -lcurl"
2. Run the test with following command.
   "./persistentConnection https://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/v1/pkg?x=y 2>/dev/null"

   Example:
   "./persistentConnection https://172.16.127.131:81/v1/pkg?x=y 2>/dev/null"
